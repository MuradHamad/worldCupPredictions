### How "Best 3rd" Slots Are Filled — Annexe C System
- After group stage, identify WHICH 8 groups produced the best 8 third-placed teams
- Look up that exact combination in the **Annexe C table (495 possible combinations)**
- Annexe C tells you exactly which third-placed team goes to which match slot
- The label (e.g., "Best 3rd of BEFIJ") means that slot can ONLY receive a third-placed team from one of those groups — it's a restriction, not a selection pool
